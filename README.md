### Portfolio
***

This is a collection of my growing portfolio of work. Check back for updates to the categories here. 

I really enjoy learning new languages and tools. You'll see, that as I work through my curriculum at The Tech Academy, I have focused on those languages. Now that I am finishing my last two courses- Python and C#, I am exploring these, as well as languages I am learning on the side like Java. I have also circled back to work on improving my front end developer skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've recently incorporated Bootstrap into my programming too. I am working through the Front End Developer Certificate program on FreeCode Camp.
